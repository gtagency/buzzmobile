# CI Scripts

This is a collection of bash scripts that run in continuous integration, but
they can be run locally too.

- `simulation` - runs tests in `buzzmobile/buzzmobile/tests/simulation`
- `unittest` - runs tests in `buzzmobile/buzzmobile/tests/unit`
- `style` - runs pylint style checks on all code based on `ci_scripts/pylint/pylintrc`
